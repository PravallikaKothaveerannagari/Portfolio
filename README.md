# Hello #
and welcome to my (mostly) Python portfolio.

# The Projects #
The portfolio contains of two projects: Shroomcast and RBF_R. Shroomcast is much more advanced (it showcases Django's Class-based views and API communication), RBF was one of my early creations and RBF_R is a modernized version. It mostly showcases Flask and file-manipulation in Python.
Hope you will enjoy both of them.
Please keep an eye on the udpdates. There will be more!
